00:00:03.944 --> 00:00:08.935
Yeah. Hello. Hello, everyone. So
this is Ruth, one with me I

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/18-1
00:00:08.935 --> 00:00:09.344
have.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/37-0
00:00:10.784 --> 00:00:15.257
A teacher party and Ganesh
myself abhaya. So the topic is

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/37-1
00:00:15.257 --> 00:00:19.730
about cloud migration business
case. We like for American

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/37-2
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:20.424
Airlines.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/59-0
00:00:22.464 --> 00:00:25.899
So basically the views like the
American Airlines is aiming to

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/59-1
00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:28.952
improve the customer, their
customer experience through

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/59-2
00:00:28.952 --> 00:00:30.424
digital transformation, so.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/70-0
00:00:32.184 --> 00:00:36.584
Their key goals is to integrate
this to the migrate their.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/90-0
00:00:36.824 --> 00:00:39.541
Environment to the cloud, like
modernising the customer facing

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/90-1
00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:41.784
applications and overcoming the
legacy constraints.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/97-0
00:00:43.384 --> 00:00:46.824
So to achieve this they are
looking into.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/108-0
00:00:46.864 --> 00:00:51.407
Migrating the vertical workloads
to the cloud, leaving behind the

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/108-1
00:00:51.407 --> 00:00:52.784
legacy applications.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/125-0
00:00:53.264 --> 00:00:57.091
So this presentation, we will
see the workloads comparison,

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/125-1
00:00:57.091 --> 00:01:00.664
cloud providers and performance
and migration strategy.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/129-0
00:01:02.944 --> 00:01:05.024
So the applications.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/154-0
00:01:06.784 --> 00:01:11.412
That are going to be migrated
for them are like a.com customer

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/154-1
00:01:11.412 --> 00:01:15.820
facing mobile applications and
global network of checked in

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/154-2
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.024
kiosk and customer website so.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/208-0
00:01:19.984 --> 00:01:23.438
Basically, what are the
workloads for migration is like

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/208-1
00:01:23.438 --> 00:01:26.460
the airlines website
thisistheirway.com is their

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/208-2
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.346
website official website, so the
airline's website needs to be

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/208-3
00:01:30.346 --> 00:01:34.109
scalable on as well as adaptable
to handle the fluctuate the

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/208-4
00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:37.563
fluctuations in terms of
volumes. So there will be more

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/208-5
00:01:37.563 --> 00:01:41.510
traffic so they have to handle
that. So for the customer facing

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/208-6
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:42.744
mobile applications.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/239-0
00:01:44.984 --> 00:01:49.280
This actually provides the
travel information about and

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/239-1
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.037
booking and functionalities of
the applications, so it should

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/239-2
00:01:54.037 --> 00:01:58.946
be very scalable and reliable.
So the connectivity should be so

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/239-3
00:01:58.946 --> 00:01:59.944
flawless and.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/246-0
00:02:01.504 --> 00:02:04.464
In terms of global network of
checking kiosk.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/271-0
00:02:06.074 --> 00:02:09.360
This, as mentioned it is a
self-service Chios, available

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/271-1
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.358
faster, check insurance and
baggage handling at the

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/271-2
00:02:12.358 --> 00:02:15.702
airport's. So for in this case
the date doesn't should be

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/271-3
00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:18.354
synchronised and the security
should be very.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/275-0
00:02:19.914 --> 00:02:21.034
Like a security.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/284-0
00:02:23.154 --> 00:02:26.554
Will be very good and in cargo
customer website.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/323-0
00:02:27.914 --> 00:02:32.506
This web this application is for
tracking, booking and management

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/323-1
00:02:32.506 --> 00:02:36.889
of the tools of the fargos and
so in this case there should be

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/323-2
00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:41.341
a secure access for the for the
customers and clients. And this

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/323-3
00:02:41.341 --> 00:02:42.594
is very essential.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/324-0
00:02:43.614 --> 00:02:44.214
So.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/330-0
00:02:45.144 --> 00:02:47.304
Next will be taken by John.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/335-0
00:02:53.754 --> 00:02:55.434
OK, sure you can start.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/340-0
00:02:56.874 --> 00:02:59.834
Alright, so hi everyone.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/349-0
00:03:01.304 --> 00:03:05.544
No, there are many cloud
providers that we have and.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/381-0
00:03:10.294 --> 00:03:14.159
Many cloud providers that we
have and we'll basically take

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/381-1
00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.696
them into like, but there are
basically three leading

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/381-2
00:03:17.696 --> 00:03:21.168
contenders of the cloud
provider. So we have AWS, we

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/381-3
00:03:21.168 --> 00:03:24.574
have Azure and we have Google
Cloud amongst others.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/386-0
00:03:26.104 --> 00:03:30.904
So regarding this airline.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/448-0
00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:34.975
The the airline, which is the
product that you're working on,

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/448-1
00:03:34.975 --> 00:03:38.877
we've actually identified some
of the workloads and we have

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/448-2
00:03:38.877 --> 00:03:42.583
greeted them depending on the
leading contending service

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/448-3
00:03:42.583 --> 00:03:46.095
provider. So for theaa.com
service, we are looking at

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/448-4
00:03:46.095 --> 00:03:50.191
Amazon EC2 instances on Azure.
We are looking at Azure virtual

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/448-5
00:03:50.191 --> 00:03:54.353
machines and we are looking at
Google Cloud compete in this and

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/448-6
00:03:54.353 --> 00:03:56.824
that's for the complete aspect
of it.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/479-0
00:03:57.544 --> 00:04:01.885
I won't be considering factors
like performance and pricing and

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/479-1
00:04:01.885 --> 00:04:06.362
integration with regards to some
of these, and then when you come

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/479-2
00:04:06.362 --> 00:04:10.432
to the mobile app services you
are looking at Amazon Mobile

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/479-3
00:04:10.432 --> 00:04:10.704
Hub.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/492-0
00:04:10.744 --> 00:04:14.076
Which is also equivalent to
Azure App service and we are

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/492-1
00:04:14.076 --> 00:04:16.064
looking at Firebase Google
Cloud.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/560-0
00:04:17.464 --> 00:04:22.008
And this has to be considered
based on the development work

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/560-1
00:04:22.008 --> 00:04:26.703
for thieves and Filmworks and
back and services and languages

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/560-2
00:04:26.703 --> 00:04:31.626
used in these in building of the
mobile app. When you talk about

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/560-3
00:04:31.626 --> 00:04:36.246
the check in kiosk, which is
also a service being offered by

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/560-4
00:04:36.246 --> 00:04:40.942
this airline, we are looking at
Amazon API Gateway, Azure API

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/560-5
00:04:40.942 --> 00:04:45.713
management and AP G API platform
for Google and this has to be

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/560-6
00:04:45.713 --> 00:04:49.424
considered based on the API
management features.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/571-0
00:04:49.504 --> 00:04:53.202
Security. The integration
solutions with regards to taking

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/571-1
00:04:53.202 --> 00:04:53.704
care of.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/592-0
00:04:54.664 --> 00:04:58.994
But the cargo website. So we are
looking at Amazon S3 buckets. We

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/592-1
00:04:58.994 --> 00:05:02.209
are looking at Azure BLOB
Storage, which is also

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/592-2
00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:03.784
equivalent of an object.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/640-0
00:05:05.344 --> 00:05:10.311
An object data platform which is
always a non binary platform. We

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/640-1
00:05:10.311 --> 00:05:14.450
are looking at Google Cloud
storage and this has to be

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/640-2
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.965
considered based on the data
retrieval times. The lifetime,

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/640-3
00:05:18.965 --> 00:05:23.180
the access control, the
permissions and the even though

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/640-4
00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.996
the attenuation required to get
data and store data within this

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/640-5
00:05:27.996 --> 00:05:28.824
particular.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/644-0
00:05:29.924 --> 00:05:32.804
Region. Next slide, please.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/658-0
00:05:37.334 --> 00:05:41.775
Right. So we are talking about
the migration strategies and

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/658-1
00:05:41.775 --> 00:05:43.774
tools and we've identified.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/712-0
00:05:45.094 --> 00:05:48.786
So far, many migration
strategies, but we'll have to

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/712-1
00:05:48.786 --> 00:05:53.035
start off with the REHOSTING
now. A rehosting is more like a

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/712-2
00:05:53.035 --> 00:05:57.145
cost effective option for
migrating workload. And when you

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/712-3
00:05:57.145 --> 00:06:00.977
talk about re hosting, we are
considering factors like

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/712-4
00:06:00.977 --> 00:06:05.226
minimising migration time and
cost for workloads that aren't

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/712-5
00:06:05.226 --> 00:06:07.734
running compete intensive
services.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/780-0
00:06:08.254 --> 00:06:12.875
But the limitation of hosting
may not be as cost effective in

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/780-1
00:06:12.875 --> 00:06:16.899
the long run due to the
underutilizing cloud features

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/780-2
00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:21.296
like scalability and elasticity.
We'll also talk about the

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/780-3
00:06:21.296 --> 00:06:25.768
Replatform and the platform we
have to consider modernising

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/780-4
00:06:25.768 --> 00:06:30.165
existing applications to benefit
from cloud features while

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/780-5
00:06:30.165 --> 00:06:34.487
minimising code changes, and
this can be improved in many

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/780-6
00:06:34.487 --> 00:06:38.214
ways such as performance,
scalability, potential.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/787-0
00:06:38.394 --> 00:06:40.994
Cost compared to pure left and
ship.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/819-0
00:06:42.504 --> 00:06:46.690
We are also talking about the
migration tools and this could

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/819-1
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:51.083
be a little bit beneficial based
on it simplifies and automates

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/819-2
00:06:51.083 --> 00:06:55.063
the migration process within
manual efforts and potential

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/819-3
00:06:55.063 --> 00:06:55.544
errors.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/847-0
00:06:57.544 --> 00:07:01.884
It also chooses the tool based
on our cloud provider, such as

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/847-1
00:07:01.884 --> 00:07:06.224
whether we are using either BS
or whether we are going to use

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/847-2
00:07:06.224 --> 00:07:10.424
Azure or whether we are going to
use Google Cloud services.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/867-0
00:07:10.754 --> 00:07:15.935
And all of these are migration,
strategy, lift and ship versus

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/867-1
00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:21.034
repatforming. Now additional
factors to consider is security.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/946-0
00:07:21.864 --> 00:07:25.913
We have to ensure that our
applications are secure in the

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/946-1
00:07:25.913 --> 00:07:30.033
cloud and that cloud providers
offer security to some best

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/946-2
00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:33.594
practises to guide these
applications. We are also

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/946-3
00:07:33.594 --> 00:07:37.713
considering downtime for minimal
downtime during migration

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/946-4
00:07:37.713 --> 00:07:42.182
whenever we're trying to migrate
the business fees and for also

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/946-5
00:07:42.182 --> 00:07:46.232
to minimise disruption of
services. We would also have to

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/946-6
00:07:46.232 --> 00:07:50.351
factor in testing and thorough
testing of our applications

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/946-7
00:07:50.351 --> 00:07:53.144
after migration should also be
ensured.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/972-0
00:07:53.624 --> 00:07:57.812
So that whenever they get to the
cloud, they can be able to

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/972-1
00:07:57.812 --> 00:08:02.210
function properly. I think the
other slide would be carried on

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/972-2
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.584
by by other colleague. Thank
you.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/975-0
00:08:15.984 --> 00:08:16.784
Finish.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/983-0
00:08:31.724 --> 00:08:33.804
Denise, are you there? Hello.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/987-0
00:08:39.494 --> 00:08:40.854
Hello, Denise.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/989-0
00:08:41.904 --> 00:08:42.944
Am I audible?

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/994-0
00:08:43.834 --> 00:08:45.474
Yeah, you're very much audible.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/996-0
00:08:48.774 --> 00:08:49.774
Hi, Denise.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/1002-0
00:08:53.984 --> 00:08:56.744
Is facing some issue with this
mic it seems.

9085a455-14aa-41fc-b030-ed49d4d24427/1005-0
00:09:04.564 --> 00:09:06.044
We post the recording.
